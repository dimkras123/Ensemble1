    "# In statistics and machine learning, the bias–variance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models \n",
    "# whereby models with a lower bias in parameter estimation have a higher variance of the parameter estimates \n",
    "# across samples, and vice versa. The bias–variance dilemma or bias–variance problem is the conflict in trying \n",
    "# to simultaneously minimize these two sources of error that prevent supervised learning algorithms from \n",

    "# The bias error is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm. \n",
    "# High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs \n",
    "# (underfitting).\n",
    "# The variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High variance can cause \n",
    "# an algorithm to model the random noise in the training data, rather than the intended outputs (overfitting)."
